#Lab 1: Data analysis in R: Oceanographic profile

#ES 383 September 2018

This lab serves as an introduction to the data analysis, visualization, and interpretation that you will conduct throughout the semester. The tools that are introduced here can be used to graph and analyze data in your labs, data you collect in the field, and data from your independent project. You can use the exercises here as a template for your future analyses.

Moreover, this lab provides experience in writing code—a skill that is becoming increasingly relevant in almost every field.

You will use files from sampling done along the Damariscotta Estuary. The data set used here is:	Lab01example.csv – CTD data from the deep station

It will be most useful to you in the long term to install R and R-studio on your own computer. However, if you prefer, we can set you up to use R-server, so that you can use R through a web browser.

Installing R and R-studio

1.  Install R program at: http://cran.rstudio.com/
This site has options for download for Linux, Mac, and Windows
 
2.  Install r-studio  (R interface)
http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
Under “installers” you should see options for Mac and Windows

GRAPHING

Some basic tips on scientific figures

1. Display information as clearly and simply as possible
2. Label axes (with units in parentheses) and any other critical information
3. Provide details in the figure caption. Don't restate information that should be clear from the figure. However, sometimes it might be helpful to call out a key feature.
4. A title above the figure us optional, but usually not needed. 
5. Font should be an easily readable size
